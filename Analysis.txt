Analysis of WeatherPy Data

1. The obvious observation is that temperature increases at a near even rate as you get closer to the equator both from the north and south.

2. Wind speed and cloudiness seem unaffected by latitude change. The distribution seems even and similar in both directions from the equator.

2. Humidity increases sharply at the equator but then becomes more evenly distributed the further away you go.
